/**
 * The {@code interfaces.dao} package contains interfaces that define data access operations.
 * 
 * <p>Interfaces in this package provide a contract for classes that are responsible for interacting
 * with the underlying data storage mechanisms. These interfaces define common methods for creating,
 * reading, updating, and deleting data entities.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Classes that implement these interfaces typically handle the low-level details of data storage,
 * such as database queries, file I/O, or communication with external services.</p>
