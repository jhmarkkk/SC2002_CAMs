/**
 * The {@code enums} package contains Java enumerations that represent a set of named constants.
 * 
 * <p>Enums in this package are used to define fixed sets of values that represent different states,
 * types, or options within the application. They enhance code readability and maintainability by
 * providing a clear and self-documenting way to represent specific, predefined values.</p>
 * 
 * <p>Enums are often used in switch statements, configuration settings, and situations where a
 * finite set of options is expected.</p>
