/**
 * The {@code controllers} package contains classes that manage the application's control flow.
 * Controllers handle user input, process requests, and coordinate interactions between the user interface and the underlying business logic.
 * 
 * <p>Key responsibilities of classes in this package include routing, handling user actions, and updating the view based on changes in the underlying data models.</p>
 * 
 * <p>This package plays a crucial role in implementing the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, where controllers act as intermediaries between models and views.</p>
