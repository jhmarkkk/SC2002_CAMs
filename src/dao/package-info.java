/**
 * The {@code dao} package contains Data Access Object (DAO) classes responsible for interacting
 * with the underlying data storage and performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
 * 
 * <p>DAO classes abstract the details of data storage and retrieval, providing a clean interface
 * for the rest of the application to interact with the data models. They often use specific
 * persistence technologies (such as databases or file systems) to manage data persistence.</p>
 * 
 * <p>These classes are crucial for separating the concerns of data access from the rest of the
 * application, promoting maintainability, scalability, and testability of the codebase.</p>
